Please generate an induced subgraph of the network that includes only the 3-digit industry nodes listed in 
Fig.5 of the working paper by Tafti, Rahmati and Westland (2015).
Make a distinct color or shape for the nodes '511','541','518', and '519'. 
Make the width of the edges proportional to the (logarithm of) edge weights, and make the size of the nodes proportional to any measure of
node centrality of your choosing. Use the Fruchterman Reingold layout, or any other layout of your choosing.
